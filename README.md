## Hi there 👋
#### I am Abdulrahman Alharbi , An Information System(Data Science track) graduate
---
i do enjoy low level language's power and control,and High level languages ease of use as such you might see my c++ code written in c style c++.
  Currently i am working on several projects :
  - Vectra : a Regex replacement project,goal is to be **Readable**, **Fast**, and **Lightweight**. Currently written in C.
  - Canvas : a CPU Rasterization single header, it mimicks the normal drawing pipe line via lambdas and per draw function context object.
  - Fast-Math(Atan2 only for now) : using optimization techniques such as **Branchless Programming** , **Single Instruction Multiple Data(SIMD)** and **Instruction Level Parallelism(ILP)**, we achieved 0.23 nanosecond per atan2 Pair in SIMD 8 floats while still maintaining IEEE 754 compliance in the accurate version (which has max error of 2.57e-05 radians and average of 1.06e-05 radians and it still zoom into zero at octants edges).
  - Toxic Speech detection and criticism reinterpretation : Goal is to help online platforms to hide toxic speech and reinterpret useful but foul mouthed criticism into neutral clear criticism.

now a Question one might ask , "Why? why all of those? you should make a single project one at a time." 
- answer is : to avoid **burnout** ,by having **diverse projects** i don't tire as fast and the **joy** of programming still **persist** ,and by having those **different** projects, i look at problems from more than one **perspective**.
- Plans and Logic are pre-written , only application remains which is the thing that takes time to do right.
